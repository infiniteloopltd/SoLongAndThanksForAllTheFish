                We’re sorry to say that we are closing <span id="website">{website}</span> down, for good. It was fun while it lasted, but we decided that it’s time to close the curtains on some of our websites that are no longer viable.

                At their prime, tens of thousands of people would visit these sites, on a daily basis, and I hope that perhaps some useful connections were made. However, as sad as it is to say goodbye, the time has come.
